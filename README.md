# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

## Dataset

CIFAR-10 is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.

## Algorithms

### Machine learning
- SVM
- Logistic Regression

## Aspiration

The goal of this project is to test how well machine learning algorithms with good feature extraction can learn complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and to compare their results to the results of a thin CNN.
